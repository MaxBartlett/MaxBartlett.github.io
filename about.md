Hey! My name is Max Bartlett and I'm a recent graduate of Duke University, where I earned a B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Religion and Arabic. I work as a software engineer at Visa Inc. in Denver, CO. In my free time I enjoy playing woodwind instruments and guitar, learning languages (both human and computer), brewing gongfu tea, watching the Criterion Channel, and spending time outdoors with friends.
