My name is Max Bartlett and I'm a recent graduate of Duke University, where I earned a B.S. of Computer Science with minors in Religion and Arabic. I'm currently employed as a software engineer at Visa Inc. in Denver, CO. Outside of my job, I'm passionate about helping nonprofits with their tech needs and improving resources for K-12 CS education. In my free time I enjoy playing woodwind instruments and guitar, learning languages (both human and computer), brewing gongfu tea, cooking, and spending time outdoors with friends.
