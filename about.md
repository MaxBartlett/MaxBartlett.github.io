<p> I'm originally from Scottsdale, AZ, but I currently live in Durham, NC, where I'm a junior at Duke University. I'm majoring in Computer Science with minors in Arabic and Religion.

<p> During my freshman year at Duke, I was fortunate to be accepted to the <a href = "https://focus.duke.edu/clusters-courses/middle-east-islam-global-contexts"> Middle East and Islam in Global Contexts FOCUS Cluster</a>. This academic program, alongside Arabic coursework, sparked my interest in the Middle East. I was able to leverage this experience by participating in <a href = "https://dukeengage.duke.edu/program/jordan/"> DukeEngage Jordan</a> the following summer.

<p> Throughout my nine-week stay in Amman, Jordan, I worked an intern for the Justice Center for Legal Aid, the largest legal aid provider in Jordan. Outside of my work at the JCLA, I volunteered with a local charity to provide aid to Syrian refugees in the city of Mafraq. I hope to continue to use my skills to contribute to projects in the Middle East, improve Arabic language learning tools for English speakers, and foster a better understanding of the Arab World in the United States.</p>

<p> In my sophomore year at Duke, I rediscovered my passion for programming that began in high school and declared my major as Computer Science. During this past summer, I worked as an an undergraduate researcher in the Duke Computer Science Department. I also spent a month working for the HR department of Farm Sanctuary, one of the largest animal protection organizations in the U.S.

<p> This year, I'm continuing to remain engaged by working as a teaching assistant for two data science courses and exploring new clubs and other activities at Duke. I'm also seeking an internship in software engineering or data science for summer 2019.
